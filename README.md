# Factollection
## Personal fun fact collection

Factollection is where you can get and organize the fun facts you want!

---

## Concept: 
In Factollection once you have login you have your own fact sheets collection, and ability to search for fun facts based on date, math, trivia or random choice. After seeing your chosen fact you may save it to your related sheet. You also may add notes and further study links to the facts sheets you save.
